### Conference Networking App

Personal project to work on while learning web development, a simple web app which 
- includes user registration where it takes contact details/linkedin,etc.
- allows people to search for and mark other delegates with whom they'd like to share their contact
- after the conference ends people can get an export of contacts (maybe directly to google account if feasible)
